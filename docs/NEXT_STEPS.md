NEXT STEPS to make InderAI production-ready:

1. Integrate a hosted LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic) and secure API keys in secrets.
2. Replace FAISS with managed vector DB (Pinecone/Milvus) for scaling.
3. Implement authentication & RBAC for admin API.
4. Create unit tests and integration tests.
5. Add monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) and logging (Sentry).
6. Prepare dataset collection pipeline and real annotated matches for training.
7. If you want RL/self-play, design simplified environment & allocate GPUs.
